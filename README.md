This app was made as a ReactJS challenge by Juan Rebella (https://github.com/JRebella) on May 2020

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

To start the app in development mode first install all the dependencies using

### `yarn`

Then run the "start" script to launch a local server in [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) which you can open in your browser

### `yarn start`
